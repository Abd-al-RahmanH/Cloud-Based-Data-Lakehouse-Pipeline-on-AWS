# Building a Cloud-Based Data Lakehouse Pipeline on AWS

In today's data-driven world, organizations are increasingly relying on data lakehouses—modern data architectures that combine the benefits of data lakes and data warehouses. In this blog, we'll explore how to build a cloud-based data lakehouse pipeline on AWS, leveraging AWS Glue, Airflow, Python, and Redshift. We'll design an end-to-end pipeline that streams, cleans, processes, and layers data into an optimized structure, ready for business analytics.

## Key Components of the Data Lakehouse Pipeline:
1. **Automated Data Pipeline** using Airflow, Python, and AWS Glue.
2. **Multi-Layer Architecture** (Bronze, Silver, and Gold) for data organization in S3.
3. **Optimized for Analytics** using AWS Glue Data Catalog and Redshift.

Let's break down these components and build a fully functional pipeline, with an example to guide you through the process.

## 1. **End-to-End Data Pipeline: Streaming Ingestion, Cleaning, and Processing**

The first step in the data lakehouse pipeline is to ingest and process data. We'll leverage the following AWS services:
- **AWS Glue**: A fully managed ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) service.
- **Airflow**: An orchestration tool for managing and scheduling ETL jobs.
- **Python**: To write custom ETL scripts for AWS Glue.

### Example Use Case:
Imagine we have a streaming data source providing e-commerce transactions. We'll ingest this data, clean it, and process it into a usable format.

### Step 1: Setting Up Airflow on AWS
1. **Create an Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow (MWAA)** environment:
   - Go to the AWS Management Console.
   - Navigate to **Amazon MWAA**.
   - Set up a new environment, specifying parameters like the VPC, S3 bucket for DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs), and Airflow version.
   - Configure your environment with access to AWS services like S3, Glue, and Redshift.
  
2. **Create a DAG**: A DAG in Airflow defines the workflow. Here’s a simplified DAG for our pipeline:

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.providers.amazon.aws.operators.glue import AwsGlueJobOperator
from airflow.utils.dates import days_ago

default_args = {
    'owner': 'airflow',
    'start_date': days_ago(1),
    'retries': 1,
}

dag = DAG(
    'data_lakehouse_pipeline',
    default_args=default_args,
    description='AWS Glue ETL pipeline for data lakehouse',
    schedule_interval='@daily',
)

run_glue_job = AwsGlueJobOperator(
    task_id='run_glue_etl',
    job_name='my-glue-job',
    script_location='s3://my-bucket/glue-scripts/etl_script.py',
    region_name='us-west-2',
    dag=dag,
)
```

This DAG triggers an AWS Glue job daily.

### Step 2: Writing the AWS Glue ETL Job
1. **Create an AWS Glue job**:
   - Go to AWS Glue.
   - Navigate to **Jobs** and create a new job.
   - Select the Python language and choose a script path (this can be stored in S3).
  
2. **ETL Script**:
   Here’s a simple example that ingests data from an S3 bucket, cleans it, and writes it back to another location:

```python
import sys
from awsglue.transforms import *
from awsglue.utils import getResolvedOptions
from pyspark.context import SparkContext
from awsglue.context import GlueContext
from awsglue.job import Job

args = getResolvedOptions(sys.argv, ['JOB_NAME'])

sc = SparkContext()
glueContext = GlueContext(sc)
spark = glueContext.spark_session
job = Job(glueContext)
job.init(args['JOB_NAME'], args)

# Load data from S3
source_data = glueContext.create_dynamic_frame.from_options(
    connection_type="s3",
    connection_options={"paths": ["s3://my-bucket/bronze/transactions/"]},
    format="json"
)

# Perform transformations
cleaned_data = source_data.resolveChoice(specs=[('amount', 'cast:double')])

# Write data back to S3
glueContext.write_dynamic_frame.from_options(
    frame=cleaned_data,
    connection_type="s3",
    connection_options={"path": "s3://my-bucket/silver/transactions/"},
    format="parquet"
)

job.commit()
```

This script:
- Reads raw transaction data from the **Bronze** layer.
- Cleans and transforms it.
- Writes the cleaned data to the **Silver** layer in S3 as Parquet files.

---

## 2. **Data Layering: Bronze, Silver, Gold Architecture in S3**

To manage the lifecycle and transformation of data, we employ a **multi-layer architecture**. This allows for clear organization and governance of data as it progresses from raw to business-ready formats.

### **Bronze Layer**:
- Raw, unprocessed data from various sources.
- Format: JSON, CSV, or any native format.
  
### **Silver Layer**:
- Data that has been cleaned and structured.
- Format: Parquet, optimized for further analysis.
  
### **Gold Layer**:
- Final, business-ready data.
- Enriched data sets ready for analytics and reporting.
- Format: Parquet, but optimized for tools like Amazon Redshift Spectrum or Athena.

Here’s how you can manage these layers in S3:
1. Create folders in S3 for each layer:
   - **s3://my-bucket/bronze/**
   - **s3://my-bucket/silver/**
   - **s3://my-bucket/gold/**
2. Store data accordingly as it moves through the ETL pipeline.

---

## 3. **Optimized for Analytics: AWS Glue Data Catalog and Redshift**

Once data is processed and stored, it’s time to make it queryable and accessible for business intelligence (BI) tools like QuickSight, Tableau, or custom dashboards.

### Step 1: AWS Glue Data Catalog
1. **Create a Data Catalog**:
   - In AWS Glue, go to **Databases** and create a new database.
   - Register tables in the catalog for both the Silver and Gold layers.
   - AWS Glue crawlers can automate this process by crawling your S3 bucket and detecting schema changes.
  
2. **Use AWS Glue Crawlers**:
   - Create a new crawler in Glue.
   - Set it to crawl your S3 bucket (Silver/Gold layers) and automatically populate the data catalog.

### Step 2: Integrating with Amazon Redshift
1. **Create a Redshift Cluster**:
   - In the AWS Management Console, create a Redshift cluster.
   - Configure it to use the AWS Glue Data Catalog for metadata management.
  
2. **Query Data Using Redshift Spectrum**:
   - Use Amazon Redshift Spectrum to query data directly from S3 without having to load it into Redshift.
   - Example query:

```sql
CREATE EXTERNAL SCHEMA my_schema
FROM DATA CATALOG DATABASE 'my_glue_database' 
IAM_ROLE 'arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/MyRedshiftRole'
CREATE EXTERNAL DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS;
 
SELECT * FROM my_schema.transactions
WHERE transaction_date > '2024-01-01';
```

## Conclusion

By leveraging AWS services like Glue, Redshift, and S3, alongside orchestration with Airflow, we've built an automated, cloud-based data lakehouse pipeline. This pipeline ingests, cleans, structures, and stores data in a multi-layered architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold), ready for analytics and business intelligence.

With this setup, you can seamlessly manage your data, improve query performance, and unlock insights from your data with powerful BI tools. This architecture is scalable and adaptable for diverse use cases, making it a strong foundation for modern data engineering practices on AWS.
